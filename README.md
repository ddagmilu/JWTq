## Description

JWTq is a lightweight JSON Web Token (JWT) library designed to enhance security and performance in IoT environments using MQTT. Our library focuses on minimizing token size and resource usage while maintaining robust security measures. JWTq is particularly suited for resource-constrained IoT devices that require efficient and secure communication protocols.
