## Description

JWTq is a lightweight JSON Web Token (JWT) library designed to enhance security and performance in IoT environments using MQTT. Our library focuses on minimizing token size and resource usage while maintaining robust security measures. JWTq is particularly suited for resource-constrained IoT devices that require efficient and secure communication protocols.

## Features

- **Lightweight Tokens:** Optimized JWT structure to reduce computational overhead and enhance performance.
- **Enhanced Security:** Uses minimal claims and leverages a third-party server for rule management, increasing security through obscurity.
- **Efficient Authentication:** Supports rapid token issuance and renewal processes with minimal impact on system performance.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle millions of IoT devices without compromising on performance or security.
- **Easy Integration:** Simple configuration and deployment with the Mosquitto MQTT broker.

## Installation

To install JWTq, follow these steps:

```bash
pip install jwtq
